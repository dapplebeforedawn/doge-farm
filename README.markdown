#Doge Farm

You breed Shiba Inu (colloquially referred to as doge in "these parts") at a very successful free-range doge farm in western Montana.  A letter has just arrived by pony express, informing you that the first annual Doge Convention! will take place in one week in the city of Oakland, California.  "Hot dog!", you bellow into the succulent Montana morning mist, "I've always wanted to visit the Javascript capital of the world."

So you begin making preparations for your trip.  First order of business is to rent a large truck, so that you can bring as many doge with you as possible.  You call up the local U-Haul franchise and excitedly tell the clerk all about the up coming convention.

You are curtly informed that there is no truck available large enough to fit all of your doge because there is concurrently a gopher convention in Mountain View, California, and the local gopher growers association has already reserved the largest trucks.

The U-Haul-troll informs you that he only has two trucks available, one that will hold 10,000lbs of doge, and a larger one that will hold 2,000,000lbs.  Resilient person that you are, you accept the trucks, and begin a very large yack-shave:

You have catalogued your doge, and truck situation in the two included files.  One for the 10,000lbs truck, detailing 1/5th of you doge holdings, and another file for the 2,000,000lbs truck with records for _all_ of your doge (500 head of doge, winning!).  The files are formated thusly:

```
[truck_size][number_of_doge_on_your_farm]
[value_of_doge_1] [weight_of_doge_1]
[value_of_doge_2] [weight_of_doge_2]
...
```

If the large truck holds 2,000,000lbs of doge, and you have many doge, each with a different weight, and different market value (the red ones are especially valuable!), what is the maximum value of doge you can bring with you to O-town?

A strange but reliable vagabond correctly informs you that the best you can do with the 10,000lbs truck and 100 doge is: $2,493,893 worth

_No, you can not take fractional doge, you sick-o_
